  # User with this name on masters will be able to ssh to users defined on
  # slaves in the same group, but access from slaves to masters won't be
  # allowed. So if you need to have a mesh access (all nodes should have access
  # to all others), you just need to have the same set of masters and slaves.
  # If you do not need to have a shell access (if you need only portforwarding,
  # for example) you can set `shell` attribute to /bin/false and then user
  # won't be able to login but will be able to portforward.
